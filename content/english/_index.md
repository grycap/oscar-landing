This allows creating serverless workflows across the Cloud computing continuum, where some lightweight processing occurs in an on-premises Cloud (or in the edge) and intensive computing takes place in AWS Lambda.
      SCAR is also integrated with [AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch), a managed service to provision auto-scaled clusters in AWS Batch. This allows executing event-driven serverless workflows for applications that require intensive computing or specialized accelerated hardware such as GPUs."
